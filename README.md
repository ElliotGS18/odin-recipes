HTML-Foundations-Lesson-8-The-Odin-Project

-May 23 2022

This is my first big project in the Odin Project Page. If this webpage works all right, I would have learned a lot about the HTML course and set the basic steps for my web developer career. Some of the skills that this project require are:

*HTML Boiler Plate
*Elements and Tags in HTML
*How to handle text in HTML
*Working with lists in HTML
*Working with Links and Images in HTML

Besides the HTML knowledge acquired I am also going to be more comfortable with the use of Git, Github and how to do good quality commit messages

Thats all for today
